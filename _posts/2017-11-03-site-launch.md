The time has come -- months after jumping on the open domain name [benchesnut.com](http://benchesnut.com), I have finally started to populate it! Much thanks to [jmcglone and his beginner guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for getting me off the ground! It's still pretty basic, but it's still a work in progress. I hope use this opportunity to learn about html, CSS, and JavaScript over the next several months. Check back in later to see my progress!
