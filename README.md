# Ben Chesnut's personal website

Hello, and thank you for showing interest in my repository for my personal website, [benchesnut.com](http://www.benchesnut.com)!

This is a repository for me to learn and play around with html, CSS, and JavaScript. If you see anything you like here, please feel free to borrow any of my code. All I ask is that you leave a little comment in your source code acknowledging you got it from me (just as I did in my code!).
